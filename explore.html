		<h2>Our Scheme</h2>
		<p>Waste management has become a critical issue in our modern society due to the rapid increase in population. Ineffective waste disposal methods have resulted in environmental pollution and health hazards. Therefore, it is essential to adopt sustainable waste management practices such as the <span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold;">reuse and recycling of plastic, food, and already used papers or books</span>. By reusing and recycling plastic, we reduce its environmental impact and conserve natural resources. Similarly, The wasted food which can be collected from functions, marriages and other events can be supplied to the orphans or the needed ones. Food waste can also be recycled through composting which not only reduces the waste but also produces valuable fertilizer for agriculture. Additionally, already used papers or books can be recycled to produce new paper products, conserving forests and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br>By adopting sustainable waste management practices, we can minimize the impact of waste on the environment and promote a sustainable future.</p>
